        The vh is a unit of length that is equal to 1% of the height of the viewport.
        It is used in web design to define the size of elements on a web page relative
        to the height of the viewport. The vh is a relative unit of length, which means
        that the size of a vh is not fixed and can vary depending on the height of the
        viewport. The vh is commonly used in responsive web design to create layouts
        that adapt to different screen sizes.
