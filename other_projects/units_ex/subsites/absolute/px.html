      The pixel is a unit of length in digital imaging, typically used to
      express the size of images, icons, and text. Pixels are the smallest unit
      of picture that can be displayed or controlled. The definition of a pixel
      is variable and depends on the context in which it is used. Pixels are
      used to express resolution, which is the number of pixels in each
      dimension that can be displayed on a screen. The resolution of a screen is
      typically expressed as the number of pixels in each dimension, such as
      800x600 or 1024x768. The pixel is also used to express the size of images
