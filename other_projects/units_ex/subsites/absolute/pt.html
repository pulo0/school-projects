      Points are a unit of length that is equal to 1/72 of an inch. It is used
      in typography to define the size of a font. It is also used in the
      printing industry to define the size of a printed page. Points are
      commonly used in web design to define the size of text and other elements
      on a web page. Points are a relative unit of length, which means that the
      size of a point is not fixed and can vary depending on the resolution of
      the screen or printer.
