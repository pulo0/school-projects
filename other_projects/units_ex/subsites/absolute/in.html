        The inch is a unit of length in the imperial and United States customary
        systems of measurement. It is equal to 1/12 of a foot, or exactly 2.54
        centimeters. The inch is commonly used in the United States and United
        Kingdom to measure the size of objects, such as paper, screens, and
        furniture. The inch is also used in typography to define the size of a font
        or the width of a column of text. The inch is a relative unit of length,
        which means that the size of an inch is not fixed and can vary depending on
        the resolution of the screen or printer.
