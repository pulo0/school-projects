# school-projects
The entire repository of school projects that I made during school, additionally this repo contains the answers to the past exams EE09, E14, INF03 that you need to take when you're going to the technical school in Poland with IT specialization.
<br>

### Material scope of the INF03 exams are as follows:
- working with databases (RDBMS mainly like MySQL, MariaDB, MS Access or MSSQL)
- designing basic web pages, mostly utilizing vanilla HTML, CSS, JS and PHP, without using widely used framework such as React, Vue, Laravel
- basic asset/image editing, manipulation using open source program such as InkScape or GIMP
<br>

Combining this knowledge you have 100% certainty to pass the test and if you have any doubts while taking the previous exams I hope my answers to the will help :>
